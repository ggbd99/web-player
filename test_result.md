# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Result: Professional hero banner matching Cineby reference with proper logo display."

      CRITICAL VIDEO PLAYBACK FIX IMPLEMENTED:
      
      User reported that videos stopped playing after recent changes. Console showed permission policy violations.
      
      ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
      1. Conflicting iframe attributes - 'allow' attribute was causing permission violations
      2. Missing Permissions-Policy headers in next.config.js
      3. Restrictive Content-Security-Policy not allowing VidKing embeds
      
      FIXES APPLIED:
      1. ✅ Removed problematic 'allow' attribute from iframe (was conflicting with allowFullScreen)
      2. ✅ Updated Content-Security-Policy in next.config.js to allow:
         - frame-src: https://www.vidking.net https://api.videasy.net
         - media-src: * blob: data:
      3. ✅ Added Permissions-Policy header explicitly allowing:
         - autoplay=*
         - encrypted-media=*
         - fullscreen=*
         - picture-in-picture=*
      
      🎯 Video playback should now work correctly. Please test by playing any movie or TV episode.

      - Resume functionality with badges and progress bars
      - Watch history with timestamps
      - Enhanced description display

      2. Added timestamps to watch history with relative time display (e.g., "2h ago")
      3. Implemented resume functionality - clicking on content in homepage/search resumes from saved position
      4. Added visual resume indicators - "Resume" badge and progress bars on cards for partially watched content
      
      Ready for testing.

      BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED - TMDB API Integration ✅
      
      Comprehensive testing of all TMDB API endpoints completed successfully:
      
      ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY:
      - All core endpoints: search, trending, popular movies/TV, movie/TV details, season details
      - CORS headers properly configured
      - Caching working correctly (15-minute TTL, in-memory cache)
      - Error handling for invalid routes (404)
      - Parameter validation (empty queries rejected)
      - Special character handling in search
      - Multiple filter support in discover endpoint
      
      📊 TEST RESULTS: 18/19 tests passed (94.7% success rate)
      
      ⚠️ MINOR ISSUE FOUND:
      - Large page numbers (e.g., page=999) return 500 error instead of gracefully passing through TMDB's 400 error
      - This is a minor error handling issue that doesn't affect core functionality
      
      🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Backend is fully functional for production use. The minor error handling issue can be addressed in future iterations but doesn't impact core streaming functionality.
